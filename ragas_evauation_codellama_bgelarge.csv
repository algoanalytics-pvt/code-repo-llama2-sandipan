8,explain the code in merge_sort_final.py using an example,"

Explanation:

**merge_sort(arr) Function:**

This function takes an array as input and returns a sorted array using the merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm works by dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays until each sub-array has a single element. Then, it merges the sub-arrays back together by comparing the elements in order to create a new sorted array.

**merge_two_sorted_lists(a, b) Function:**

This function takes two sorted arrays (a and b) as input and returns a merged sorted array. It first checks if either of the input arrays is empty. If they are, it returns the other array since it is already sorted.

If both arrays are non-empty, it compares the first elements of both arrays (a[0] and b[0]) and adds the smaller element to the merged array. It then discards the smaller element from its original array and repeats this process until both input arrays are empty.

**Example:**

Let's say we have the following array: [10, 3, 15, 7, 8, 23, 98, 29].

**merge_sort(arr) Function:**

1.  **Divide the array into smaller sub-arrays:**

    *   The array is divided into sub-arrays of size 2: [10, 3], [15, 7], [8, 23], [98, 29].
    *   Repeat dividing the sub-arrays until each sub-array has a single element.

2.  **Merge the sub-arrays:**

    *   Merge the sub-arrays by comparing the elements in order to create a new sorted array.
    *   For example, merging [10, 3] and [15, 7] would result in [3, 7, 10, 15].

3.  **Return the sorted array:**

    *   After merging all the sub-arrays together, the sorted array is returned: [3, 7, 8, 10, 15, 23, 29, 98].

**merge_two_sorted_lists(a, b) Function:**

1.  **Input arrays:**

    *   Assuming we have two sorted arrays: a = [1, 5, 8] and b = [2, 6, 9].

2.  **Merge the arrays:**

    *   Compare the first elements of a and b, a[0] = 1 and b[0] = 2.
    *   Since 1 is smaller than 2, add 1 to the merged array.
    *   Discard 1 from a and repeat the process with the remaining elements: a = [5, 8] and b = [2, 6, 9].

3.  **Continue merging:**

    *   Compare the first elements of a and b, a[0] = 5 and b[0] = 2.
    *   Since 2 is smaller than 5, add 2 to the merged array.
    *   Discard 2 from b and repeat the process with the remaining elements: a = [5, 8] and b = [6, 9].

4.  **Repeat until all elements are merged:**

    *   Continue merging elements from a and b until all elements are added to the merged array.
    *   The final merged array is: [1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9].

5.  **Return the sorted array:**

    *   After merging all the elements from a and b, the sorted array is returned: [1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9].","[""# Code for: def merge_sort(arr):\n\n# Code for: def merge_two_sorted_lists(a,b):\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    arr = [10,3,15,7,8,23,98,29]\n\n    print(merge_sort(arr))""]","- The code defines a function called merge_sort that takes in an array as a parameter.

- It then recursively calls the merge_sort function on each half of the array.
- Finally, it merges the two sorted halves by calling the merge_two_sorted_lists function.
- The merge_two_sorted_lists function takes in two sorted lists as parameters and merges them into a single sorted list.
- The final sorted list is returned from the merge_sort function.

- [8,23] is merged into [8,23].

- By implementing the Knuth sequence for generating gap values, the shell_sort() function can achieve better performance in sorting the elements.
