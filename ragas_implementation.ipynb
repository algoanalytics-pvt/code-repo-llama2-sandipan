It then creates new columns in `temp_df` for these values.\\n*   It creates a new column `Results` in `temp_df` and populates it with the value of `results`.\\n*   It iterates over each object class in `object_classes`. For each object class, it applies the `get_count` function to the `Results` column and assigns the result to a new column in `temp_df` with the name of the object class.\\n*   It drops the `Results` column from `temp_df`.\\n*   Finally, it returns the values of `temp_df` as a numpy array.\\n\\nThe function appears to be designed to preprocess data for object-based anomaly detection. The `object_classes` parameter likely represents the different types of objects that can be detected in the data, and the `date_time` and `results` parameters represent the timing and results of the detection.
