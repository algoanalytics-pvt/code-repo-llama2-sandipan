// The code defines a functional component called Monitor, which is responsible for rendering two tabs named "Live" and "Spotlight". 
// The Tabs component is imported from "../../component/Tabs" and accepts two props, tabName and pages.

// The tabName prop is an array that contains two objects. Each object has two properties: value and label. 
// The value property is a unique identifier for each tab, and the label property is the text displayed on each tab.

// The pages prop is an array that contains two objects. Each object has two properties: value and component. 
// The value property is a reference to the value property of each object in the tabName prop. 
// The component property is a JSX element that corresponds to the content to be displayed on each tab.

// import the necessary components
import Tabs from "../../component/Tabs";
import Active from "../../component/monitor/Active";
import Spotlight from "../../component/monitor/Spotlight";
